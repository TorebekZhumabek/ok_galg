# ok_galg
Basic templated genetic algorithm in C++ 

The ok_galg project just consists in 2 header files:
- one that is an abstract class for a individual, to build ad-hoc individual for a given problem
- the other is the genetic algorithm with two usable functions

The tsp project gives an example for the classical TSP problem.
